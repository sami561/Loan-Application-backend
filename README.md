- **JWT Token Authentication**: Ensures secure communication between the client and server.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access and persistence using the Java Persistence API.
- **JSR-303 and Spring Validation**: Enables validation of objects based on annotations.
- **OpenAPI and Swagger UI Documentation**: Generates documentation for the API endpoints.
- **Docker**: Facilitates containerization of the backend application for deployment.
